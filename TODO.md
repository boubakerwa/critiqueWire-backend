    -   [ ] Implement unified `/v1/analyses/comprehensive` endpoint (supports both URL and text)
    -   [ ] Add analysis presets system (general, political, financial, scientific, opinion)
    -   [ ] Enhance AnalysisResultsData with articleId and analysisType fields
    -   [ ] Update OpenAI service to support comprehensive analysis with presets
-   [ ] **Source Credibility Assessment:**

    -   [ ] Add credibility assessment to comprehensive analysis when analyzing URLs
-   [ ] **Enhanced Analysis History:**
    -   [ ] Upgrade `/v1/analyses` endpoint with search, filtering, and pagination
    -   [ ] Add PaginatedAnalysisHistoryResponse and AnalysisHistoryItem schemas
    -   [ ] Support filtering by preset, analysis_type, date range, and search terms
    -   [ ] Implement cursor-based pagination for efficient large dataset handling

## **Phase 2: Professional Features (v0.2 - Medium Priority)**
-   [ ] **Export & Share Functionality:**
    -   [ ] Create `/v1/analyses/{analysis_id}/export` endpoint
    -   [ ] Implement PDF, DOCX, HTML, JSON, CSV export formats
    -   [ ] Add report templates (professional, academic, executive, detailed)
    -   [ ] Create `/v1/analyses/{analysis_id}/share` endpoint with secure link generation
    -   [ ] Implement share permissions and expiration handling
-   [ ] **Analysis Presets Management:**
    -   [ ] Create `/v1/analysis-presets` GET endpoint for retrieving available presets
    -   [ ] Create `/v1/analysis-presets` POST endpoint for custom preset creation
    -   [ ] Add AnalysisPreset and CreatePresetRequest schemas
    -   [ ] Support organization-level custom presets

## **Phase 3: Database Integration & Persistence**
-   [ ] **Database Schema Design:**
    -   [ ] Design tables for analyses, articles, bookmarks, user_profiles, analysis_presets
    -   [ ] Create database migration system
