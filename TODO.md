# Todo List

-   [x] ~~**Initial Project Setup & Dockerization**~~
-   [x] ~~**Implement & Debug Authentication**~~
    -   [x] ~~Setup Pydantic `Settings` in `app/core/config.py`.~~
    -   [x] ~~Create `.env.example` file.~~
    -   [x] ~~Define Pydantic schemas in `app/api/v1/schemas.py`.~~
    -   [x] ~~Create placeholder OpenAI service and API endpoints.~~
    -   [x] ~~Implement dependency to validate Supabase JWTs.~~
    -   [x] ~~Debug and fix `401 Unauthorized` errors by switching to `supabase-py` validation.~~
    -   [x] ~~Clean up debug code from endpoints and schemas.~~
-   [x] ~~**Refine OpenAI Service:**~~
    -   [x] ~~Implement actual OpenAI calls for each analysis type.~~
    -   [x] ~~Use OpenAI's JSON mode for reliable output.~~
-   [x] ~~**Implement Core OpenAI Service**~~
-   [x] ~~**Implement Frontend API Refinements (v0.1)**~~
    -   [x] ~~Implement strongly-typed analysis result schemas.~~
    -   [x] ~~Add placeholder endpoints for user profile, bookmarks, and analysis history.~~
    -   [x] ~~Add comprehensive error documentation to OpenAPI spec.~~
-   [ ] **Implement User-Specific Endpoint Logic:**
    -   [ ] Connect `/profile` endpoints to a database.
    -   [ ] Connect `/bookmarks` endpoints to a database.
    -   [ ] Connect `/analyses` endpoints to a database.
-   [ ] **Implement Asynchronous Analysis:**
    -   [ ] Replace `/analysis/article/sync` with a true background task system.
    -   [ ] The `/analysis/article` endpoint should trigger the background task.
    -   [ ] The `/analysis/{analysis_id}` endpoint should retrieve results from the database.
-   [ ] **Refine Dockerfile:**
    -   [ ] Consider multi-stage builds for a smaller production image.
-   [ ] **Testing:**
    -   [ ] Add unit and integration tests for the API.
